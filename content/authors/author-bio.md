Hello! My name is Joshua and I'm a software engineer based in Richmond, VA. I currently work at **[Markel](https://www.markel.com/)** as a cloud-based full-stack engineer. I work with a variety of technologies daily, but mostly Angular and C#. My experience at Markel has given me the opportunity to build microservices, add new lines of business to legacy products, and solve interesting problems.

When not working, you can find me rock climbing, making espresso, or spending time with my cats and partner. I also help maintain an open source project, **[Little Ram Pantries](https://littlerampantries.com/)**. You can read more about the project in it's dedicated project post. While you're there, feel free to check out some blog post and follow me on the social medias linked below!
