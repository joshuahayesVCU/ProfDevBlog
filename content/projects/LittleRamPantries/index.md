### Fighting Food Insecurity with Technology

In the Fall of 2023, I embarked on a mission to combat food insecurity at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) by developing the Little Ram Pantries Web Dashboard. This project aimed to provide consistent food access to busy students through a serverless web application that interacts with Raspberry PIs and webcams installed in newspaper stand boxes stocked with food and placed inside busy buildings on campus.

### Overcoming Challenges with Innovation

One of the major challenges we faced was limited funding. Initially, we developed a Node.js application hosted on a traditional server. However, the cost of maintaining this infrastructure proved to be unsustainable. To overcome this, we pivoted to a more robust, scalable, and cost-effective serverless architecture using AWS Lambda functions written in Go. This decision significantly reduced our costs while maintaining high performance and scalability.

### Technical Implementation

The core of our solution involved integrating React for the frontend with AWS Lambdas and Go for the backend. The Raspberry PIs, equipped with webcams, were placed inside newspaper stand boxes to monitor and stock the food supplies. These devices communicated with our serverless backend, updating the web dashboard in real-time. This system allowed us to efficiently manage food supplies and ensure they were always available to students in need.

### Recognitions and Awards

Our innovative approach and positive social impact did not go unnoticed. The Little Ram Pantries Web Dashboard was selected as one of the four recipients of the Sternheimer grant, a prestigious award given to senior capstone projects that demonstrate exceptional innovation and social impact. The application process was rigorous, requiring a detailed written proposal and an in-person presentation to a board of distinguished engineers from the community.

Furthermore, our project received a third-place award for multidisciplinary engineering projects at the final senior capstone ceremony. This recognition validated the hard work and dedication we poured into this project and highlighted the significant impact technology can have on addressing social issues.

### Future Prospects

Moving forward, we plan to continue enhancing the Little Ram Pantries Web Dashboard. We aim to incorporate more advanced features, such as fine tuning the AI algorithm that analysis new images to anticipate food shortages and integration with campus services to streamline food restocking processes. Our goal is to ensure that no student at VCU goes hungry and to inspire similar initiatives at other universities.

### Conclusion

The Little Ram Pantries Web Dashboard project has been a transformative experience, both personally and professionally. It has taught me the value of resilience and adaptability in the face of financial constraints and has reinforced my belief in the power of technology to drive social change. I am incredibly proud of what we have achieved and look forward to seeing the continued positive impact of this project on our campus community.
