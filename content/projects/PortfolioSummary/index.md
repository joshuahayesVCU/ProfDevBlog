I created this project to stake my claim in the digital space. I've always admired engineers who were skilled enough to develop their own website, and I enjoyed seeing how each one showcased it's creators personality. I created this site using Hugo, a fast and flexible static site generator. Hugo allowed me to build the website quickly and focus on the content and how it was displayed. 

### The Journey Begins

When I started this project, I had a vision of what I wanted my site to look like. I spent hours researching different static site generators and settled on Hugo because of its speed, simplicity, and robust features.  The fact that Hugo uses Markdown for content creation was a huge plus for me, as it allowed me to focus on writing without getting bogged down in HTML. I compared it to other static site generators, but ultimately choose Hugo because I wanted to utilize a project that was built with Go.

### Setting Up with Hugo

The initial setup was straightforward. I installed Hugo on my machine and quickly had a basic site up and running. The Hugo documentation and community are incredibly helpful, and I found answers to my questions with ease. Choosing a theme was the next step, and it was an enjoyable process exploring the variety of options available. I eventually chose Blowfish a theme that was clean, responsive, and customizable.

### Customization and Personalization

One of the best parts of using Hugo is the ability to customize the site to my liking. I delved into the configuration files and learned how to tweak various settings to make the site truly mine. From modifying the layout to adding custom CSS, each change made the site feel more personal. I appreciated Blowfish including built in features that enhanced functionality, such as adding a search feature, social media links, and a comments section.

### Learning and Growth

Throughout this process, I've learned a great deal about web development. Working with Hugo has taught me more about static site generators, HTML, CSS, and even a bit of JavaScript. Having previously worked with SPA applications in frameworks like React and Angular It's been a rewarding experience that has not only resulted in a website I'm proud of but also expanded my technical skill set.

### Future Plans

This site is just the beginning. I plan to continue updating it with new content and features. I want to maintain the blog section where I can share my thoughts on technology, development, and other topics I'm passionate about. 

### Conclusion

Creating this website has been a fulfilling endeavor. It stands as a testament to my growth as a developer and my commitment to carving out my own space on the internet. I'm excited to see how it evolves over time and look forward to the opportunities it will bring. If you're considering creating your own site, I highly recommend giving Hugo a try. It's a powerful tool that can help you bring your digital vision to life.
